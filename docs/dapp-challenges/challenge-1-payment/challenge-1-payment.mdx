## Soroban React Payment Challenge

This challenge will guide you through the process of setting up, customizing, and deploying the Soroban Payment DApp, a blockchain-powered payment application designed to work with the Freighter wallet.

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Install Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- `Node` (>=16.14.0 < 17.0.0): [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Yarn` (v1.22.5 or newer): [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

## Checkpoint 1: 🚀 Launch Local Backend

Clone and set up the Payment DApp repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-payment.git
cd soroban-react-payment
yarn
```

Ensure your Freighter wallet is connected to the DApp and that the experimental mode is enabled in Freighter settings: `(Settings(⚙️)>Preferences>ENABLE EXPERIMENTAL MODE).`

## Checkpoint 2: 🎬 Deploy Smart Contracts

Using the Soroban token's contract interface, construct transactions that invoke the transfer method to enable the transfer of Soroban tokens from one address to another.

## Checkpoint 4: 🤝 Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Make sure that the frontend of the Payment DApp successfully communicates with the backend, allowing transactions to be created, signed, and submitted to the network.

## Checkpoint 6: 🏦 Interaction 1 (Test Basic Functionality)

Perform a series of tests to ensure that the application's features work as expected. You could create transactions, sign them, submit them to the network, and check the updated token balance.

## Checkpoint 7: 💰 Interaction 2 (Customize Some Code)

Make some modifications to the Payment DApp code to alter its functionality or appearance. This could be a simple UI change or a more complex modification of the application's functionality.

## Checkpoint 8: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

You can upload your app to a hosting platform of your choice. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or even an AWS S3 bucket.

For this example, we will use the Vercel cli to complete our deployment

> Note: If you dont already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your github account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```sh
npm i global vercel
```

Then run the following command to deploy your app:

```sh
npx vercel
```

Then continue through the prompts(you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
🔗  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
✅  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed app! 🎉

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dApp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account), and follow the instructions to create your freighter account on Futurenet.
