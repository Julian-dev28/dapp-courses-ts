## Soroban React Payment Challenge

This challenge will guide you through the process of setting up, customizing, and deploying the Soroban Payment DApp, a blockchain-powered payment application designed to work with the Freighter wallet.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- `Node` (>=16.14.0 < 17.0.0): [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Yarn` (v1.22.5 or newer): [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Clone the Repository

Clone and set up the Payment DApp repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-payment.git
cd soroban-react-payment
yarn
```

Ensure your Freighter wallet is connected to the DApp and that the experimental mode is enabled in Freighter settings: `(Settings(‚öôÔ∏è)>Preferences>ENABLE EXPERIMENTAL MODE).`

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

For this step we will need to clone and deploy the Soroban token smart contracts. The Soroban token is a custom token that will be used to facilitate payments in the Payment DApp.

In a new terminal window, follow the steps below to build and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples.git
cd soroban-examples
cd token
make
```

This will build the smart contracts and put them in the `token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

Next, we will need to deploy the smart contracts to the testnet. To do this follow the steps below:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
    --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY>
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

This will return a contract id that we will need to use in the next step.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- initialize \
    --admin <ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --decimal 7 \
    --name '44656d6f20546f6b656e' \
    --symbol '"4454"'
```

Minting some of the token to a test account that you will use in the dapp

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id c069d458f7ce21b7d62f11d0795555f85f74e754235d5187182c7ef55b57ae7e \
    --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- mint \
    --to <USER_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --amount 1000000000
```

## Checkpoint 4: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Make sure that the frontend of the Payment DApp successfully communicates with the backend, allowing transactions to be created, signed, and submitted to the network.

## Checkpoint 6: üè¶ Interaction 1 (Test Basic Functionality)

Perform a series of tests to ensure that the application's features work as expected. You could create transactions, sign them, submit them to the network, and check the updated token balance.

## Checkpoint 7: üí∞ Interaction 2 (Customize Some Code)

Make some modifications to the Payment DApp code to alter its functionality or appearance. This could be a simple UI change or a more complex modification of the application's functionality.

## Checkpoint 8: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

You can upload your app to a hosting platform of your choice. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or even an AWS S3 bucket.

For this example, we will use the Vercel cli to complete our deployment

> Note: If you dont already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your github account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```sh
npm i global vercel
```

Then run the following command to deploy your app:

```sh
npx vercel
```

Then continue through the prompts(you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed app! üéâ

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dApp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account), and follow the instructions to create your freighter account on Futurenet.

## Checkpoint 9: ‚úÖ Complete the Challenge!
